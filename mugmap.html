    <h1>MugMap - Case Study</h1>
    <p>An imaginary mobile app project for discovering cafés based on vibe and preferences.</p>
  </header>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>MugMap is a concept mobile app designed for coffee lovers to explore nearby cafés based on their preferred atmosphere—cozy, quiet, trendy, or social. The app was created to make it easier for people to find their ideal hangout spots quickly and visually.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Users often find it hard to locate cafés that match their mood or vibe. While most maps show location and ratings, they lack deeper context about ambiance, crowd level, or ideal usage (work, meetups, solo time).</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section card">
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The goal was to design a clean, visually engaging app that helps users search for cafés using mood-based filters and a map-driven interface. It allows quick discovery, easy access to ratings, photos, and contact details.</p>
